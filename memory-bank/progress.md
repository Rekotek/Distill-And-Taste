## Current Status Metrics

### Content Completeness: 100%

- All planned sections implemented (Hero, Mission, Infusions, Moonshine, Quotes, Facts)
- Complete recipe database with 7 recipes
- Full translations for both Russian and Latvian
- All images and media assets in place

### Technical Completeness: 100%

- All CSS styling implemented and responsive
- JavaScript functionality working (language switching, smooth scrolling)
- Accessibility features implemented
- Performance optimizations in place

### Quality Assurance: 95%

- Manual testing completed across different devices and browsers

- Content accuracy verified for educational value
- **Remaining**: Could benefit from automated testing suite

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Minor Issues

1. **Content Updates**: Manual HTML editing required for content changes
2. **Translation Workflow**: Language files embedded in JavaScript (could be externalized)
3. **Image Dependencies**: External images from Pexels (consider local hosting for reliability)
4. **Analytics Missing**: No current user behavior tracking

### Technical Limitations

- **No Build Process**: Direct HTML editing without preprocessing
- **No Automated Testing**: Relies on manual testing and validation
- **Static Content**: No dynamic content or user-generated features
- **Single File Architecture**: All code in one HTML file (maintainable but monolithic)

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Choice

- **Decision**: Single HTML file with embedded CSS/JS
- **Rationale**: Simplicity, performance, no build requirements
- **Outcome**: Fast loading, easy deployment, but manual updates required

### Technology Stack

- **Decision**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS without frameworks
- **Rationale**: Lightweight, dependency-free, broad browser support
- **Outcome**: Excellent performance and compatibility, but manual implementation of features

### Content Strategy

- **Decision**: Educational focus with responsible messaging
- **Rationale**: Position as trustworthy cultural resource, not commercial product
- **Outcome**: Strong educational value, clear legal compliance, positive user reception

### Design Philosophy

- **Decision**: Paper-like aesthetic with warm color palette
- **Rationale**: Cultural authenticity, readability, professional appearance
- **Outcome**: Cohesive visual identity that matches content theme
