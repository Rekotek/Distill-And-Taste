# Active Context: Distill & Taste Website

## Current Work Focus

I am currently analyzing the Distill & Taste website project and creating its Memory Bank documentation. This involves documenting the project's structure, purpose, technology, and current state to establish a comprehensive knowledge base.

## Recent Analysis and Findings

### Project Structure Analysis

- **Single HTML File**: The entire website is contained in one `index.html` file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- **Static Architecture**: No backend or database - pure client-side implementation
- **Educational Focus**: Website serves as an informational resource about moonshine and tinctures culture

### Key Features Identified

- **Multilingual Support**: Russian and Latvian language options with complete translations
- **Recipe Database**: 7 different recipes covering both tinctures and moonshine styles
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints for different screen sizes
- **Accessibility Features**: Semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, and WCAG compliance
- **Cultural Content**: Historical context, quotes, interesting facts, and responsible consumption messaging

### Technical Implementation Notes

- **Inline CSS**: All styling embedded directly in HTML for performance
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks used - pure JavaScript for language switching and smooth scrolling
- **Image Optimization**: Responsive images with fallbacks and error handling
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript

## Current Task: Memory Bank Creation

I am systematically creating the 6 core Memory Bank files:

1. ‚úÖ **projectbrief.md** - Completed: High-level project goals and scope
2. ‚úÖ **productContext.md** - Completed: User-facing aspects and experience goals
3. ‚úÖ **techContext.md** - Completed: Technology stack and technical decisions
4. ‚úÖ **systemPatterns.md** - Completed: Architecture and design patterns
5. üîÑ **activeContext.md** - In Progress: Current work and context
6. ‚è≥ **progress.md** - Pending: Project status and completion tracking

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Documentation Strategy

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Each Memory Bank file addresses different aspects of the project
- **Technical Accuracy**: Based on direct analysis of the HTML file and its implementation
- **Future-Proofing**: Including scalability and migration considerations
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Proper handling of alcohol-related content and responsible messaging

### Content Organization

- **Logical Flow**: Files build upon each other from high-level (brief) to detailed (patterns)
- **Cross-References**: Related concepts linked between different files
- **Practical Examples**: Including code patterns and implementation details where relevant

## Next Steps

After completing the Memory Bank creation, the immediate next steps will be:

1. **Complete progress.md** - Document current project status and completion metrics
2. **Review and Validate** - Ensure all documentation accurately reflects the project
3. **Potential Enhancements** - Identify areas for technical improvements or feature additions
4. **Maintenance Planning** - Establish guidelines for future updates and modifications

## Important Learnings and Insights

### Project Strengths

- **Cultural Education**: Well-structured content that educates about beverage traditions
- **Responsible Messaging**: Clear emphasis on legal compliance and health warnings
- **Technical Simplicity**: Lightweight implementation that loads quickly and works reliably
- **Accessibility**: Good foundation for users with different abilities and devices

### Areas for Consideration

- **Content Management**: Manual updates to HTML file - could benefit from CMS integration
- **Translation Workflow**: Current system works but could be enhanced with external translation files
- **Performance Monitoring**: No current analytics - could add privacy-friendly tracking
- **SEO Optimization**: Basic semantic HTML but could be enhanced further

## Project Preferences and Standards

- **Code Style**: Clean, readable HTML with consistent indentation and organization
- **Design Philosophy**: Paper-like aesthetic with warm colors and clean typography
- **Content Standards**: Educational focus with responsible alcohol consumption messaging
- **User Experience**: Smooth interactions with progressive enhancement approach

This active context will be updated as the project evolves and new insights are gained during development and maintenance.
