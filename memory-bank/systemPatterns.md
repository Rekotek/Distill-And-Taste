# System Patterns: Distill & Taste Website

## Architecture Overview

This is a single-page application (SPA) built as a static HTML document with embedded CSS and JavaScript. The architecture follows a simple, monolithic structure optimized for performance and ease of maintenance.

## Core System Components

### 1. HTML Structure

- **Semantic Layout**: Uses semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) for accessibility and SEO
- **Modular Sections**: Content divided into logical sections (Hero, Mission, Infusions, Moonshine, Quotes, Facts)
- **Navigation System**: Fixed header with anchor links and smooth scrolling behavior

### 2. Styling System (CSS)

- **CSS Variables**: Centralized design tokens for colors, fonts, spacing, and layout
- **Component-Based Styling**: Reusable CSS classes for cards, buttons, grids, and typography
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints for tablet and desktop
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Consistent typography scale and spacing system

### 3. JavaScript Functionality

- **Language Switching**: Dictionary-based internationalization (i18n) system
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Enhanced navigation with `scrollIntoView` API
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core content accessible without JavaScript

## Key Design Patterns

### Internationalization (i18n) Pattern

```
JavaScript Dictionary → DOM Element Updates
```

- Centralized translation object with nested keys
- Event-driven language switching
- localStorage persistence for user preference
- Fallback to default language if translation missing

### Responsive Grid Pattern

```
CSS Grid + Media Queries → Adaptive Layout
```

- Flexible grid system using CSS Grid
- Breakpoint-based column adjustments
- Card-based content organization
- Aspect ratio controls for consistent image display

### Fixed Navigation Pattern

```
Sticky Header + Scroll Behavior → Enhanced UX
```

- Backdrop-filter for modern glass effect
- Smooth scroll anchors for section navigation
- Hover animations and visual feedback
- Mobile-responsive menu behavior

### Content Card Pattern

```
Semantic HTML + CSS Grid → Modular Content
```

- Consistent card structure with image, content, and metadata
- Hover effects for interactivity
- Tag system for content categorization
- Image optimization with loading states

## Data Flow Patterns

### Static Content Loading

```
HTML Document → Browser Rendering → User Interaction
```

- All content embedded in HTML for instant loading
- No external API calls or dynamic content fetching
- Images loaded with fallbacks and error handling

### Language Switching Flow

```
User Click → Language Update → DOM Manipulation → Storage Save
```

- Event listener on language buttons
- Batch DOM updates using data attributes
- Visual feedback and state management
- Persistent user preference

## Performance Patterns

### Asset Optimization

- **Inline CSS/JS**: Reduces HTTP requests for better performance
- **Image Optimization**: Responsive images with multiple sizes
- **Font Loading**: Custom font with system fallbacks
- **Lazy Loading**: Images load only when needed

### Accessibility Patterns

- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy and landmarks
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Focus management and skip links
- **Screen Reader Support**: ARIA labels and descriptive text
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG-compliant color combinations

## Error Handling Patterns

### Image Fallback System

```
Primary Image → Error Event → Fallback Image
```

- Graceful degradation for broken images
- Loading states with shimmer effects
- Timeout-based fallbacks for slow connections

### JavaScript Enhancement

```
Core HTML → JavaScript Enhancement → Enhanced Experience
```

- Progressive enhancement ensures functionality without JS
- Error boundaries for JavaScript failures
- Feature detection for browser compatibility

## Scalability Considerations

### Content Management

- **Modular HTML Sections**: Easy to add/remove content areas
- **CSS Component Library**: Reusable styling patterns
- **Translation System**: Simple to add new languages

### Technical Debt Management

- **Inline Assets**: Consider external files if project grows
- **JavaScript Organization**: Modular functions for better maintainability
- **Testing Strategy**: Manual testing currently; could add automated tests

## Future Architectural Patterns

### Potential Enhancements

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Break into reusable HTML/CSS/JS components
- **Build System**: Add Webpack/Vite for asset optimization
- **State Management**: Implement simple state management for complex interactions
- **API Integration**: Add backend for dynamic content or user features

### Migration Strategies

- **Framework Adoption**: Could migrate to React/Vue for component reusability
- **Progressive Web App**: Add service worker for offline functionality
- **Headless CMS**: Integrate with content management system for easier updates
