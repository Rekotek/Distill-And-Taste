This website serves as an educational platform dedicated to the cultural aspects of homemade spirits production and consumption. It provides users with:

- **Historical and Cultural Insights**: Information about the traditions, historical uses (e.g., medicinal applications), and regional variations in distillation and infusion practices
- **Educational Content**: Facts about responsible consumption, tasting techniques, and the importance of moderation
- **Interactive Elements**: Language switching between Russian and Latvian, smooth scrolling navigation, and engaging visual design with images

## Who It's For

- **Primary Users**: Adults (21+) interested in beverage culture, home experimentation with spirits, and cultural education about distillation
- **Secondary Users**: Enthusiasts seeking responsible ways to engage with traditional beverage-making practices

## User Experience Goals

- **Educational Value**: Users should leave with a deeper understanding of the history and responsible practices around moonshine and tinctures
- **Engagement**: The website should feel welcoming and informative, with clear navigation and visually appealing content
- **Responsibility**: All content must emphasize legal compliance, health warnings, and the educational nature of the project
